Note: before running mdiss, make sure that SolarSoftware (SSW) with
         the sdo, vso, and ontology packages is installed on your
         system, and that the corresponding environment variables are
         correctly set. (For more details about SSW,

    				 	       provided in
    				 	       /mdiss/scripts folder,
