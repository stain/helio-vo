X.Bonnin, 16-SEP-2012

Note: before running sdoss, make sure that SolarSoftware (SSW) with
         the sdo, vso, and ontology packages is installed on your
         system, and that the corresponding environment variables are
         correctly set. (For more details about SSW, 
	 visit http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/.)

FROM IDL
---------------

    sdoss_processing.pro:	This is the main IDL routine to run
                                                sdoss. It is located
                                                in the /sdoss/src
                                                folder, and can be
                                                launched from an IDL
                                                interpreter
                                                session. (To have the

                                                arguments, please read
                                                the file's header)

    sdoss_launcher.batch:         IDL batch script located in the
      			     	                /sdoss/scripts folder.
      			     	                To run sdoss from the
      			     	                IDL interpreter, first
      			     	                edit the file with
      			     	                wanted input arguments, 
				                then from the prompt, 
						enter the following command: 
				                       IDL>@sdoss_launcher.batch  

    sdoss_processing.sav         Binary file that permits to run sdoss
    				 	       in the IDL runtime
    				 	       mode. The
    				 	       sdoss_make_bin.batch,
    				 	       provided in
    				 	       /sdoss/scripts folder,
    				 	       can be used to generate
    				 	       this file. By default,
    				 	       this file is saved in
    				 	       the /sdoss/bin folder.
                                               (See sdoss_launcher.csh script
    				 	       for an example of use,
    				 	       and the IDL documentation for
			                       more information about the IDL runtime mode.)
