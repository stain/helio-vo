 To install sdoss, just copy the sdoss root directory in your local machine.
 IDL 7.1 or later must be installed on your system. Make sure that the SolarSoftWare (SSW) 
 including the sdo, vso, and ontology packages are available, and that 
 the corresponding environment variables (e.g. $SSW_ONTOLOGY) are correctly set.

 To know how run the sdoss code, please read the howto.txt document.
