  This document describes how the HELIO integration tests are working and provides a step by step manual for test data providers to add new test data.
  All information is provided in a descriptive way, i.e. there is no need to write any Java code.
  
Introduction

  The tests are based on a set of JUnit suites. Currently only services that implement the HELIO query interface are supported.
  Moreover the tests base on the long running query interface only.

Infrastructure

  * The tests are organized in a {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven}Maven}} module called <integration-tests>.
  
  * This Maven module is stored in the HELIO {{{http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion}SVN}}: {{https://helio-vo.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/helio-vo/trunk/integration-tests}}.
    You can view the files at {{http://helio-vo.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/helio-vo/trunk/integration-tests/}}.

  * Daily at 4.00 CET the Jenkins build system fetches the content of <integration-tests> and runs the tests. 
    Alternatively a test run can be started manually by Jenkins administrators (currently Marco Soldati).
  
  * The results of these tests are published to {{http://helio-dev.i4ds.ch/hudson/job/helio-integrationtests/}}.
    Moreover a mail is sent to registered users in case of failure (send a message to Marco Soldati if you want to receive these mails)
  
Directory structure

The maven module <integration-tests> is organized as follows.

  <<NOTE:>> As provider of test data the only files that need to be changed are in the sub directories of <resources>.

The testdata file

  Each service has a <$servicename_testdata.txt> file which is organized as follows:
  
+------------------------------------------------------+
# startTime          | endTime              | from                           | where                                  | expectedResultFile
[Ljava.lang.String;  | [Ljava.lang.String;  | [Ljava.lang.String;            | java.lang.String                       | java.lang.String
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2003-02-01T00:00:00  | 2003-02-10T00:00:00  | goes_sxr_flare                 |                                        | /hec/results/goes_sxr_flare_1.xml

...  
+------------------------------------------------------+
 
  * lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
  
  * Any white spaces are ignored
  
  * the first non-comment line defines the required data type. They must not be changed as they are related to the test implementation.
  
    * <\[Lxxx;> denotes an array. E.g. <\[Ljava.lang.String;> is a <String\[\]>, <\[[Ljava.lang.String;> is a <String\[\]\[\]>.
  
  * the succeeding non-comment lines define the test data.  
  
    * Array values are separated by <,>, e.g. 2003-02-01T00:00:00,2003-02-02T00:00:00
  
  * the last column contains a pointer to the expected result file. This pointer must start with a / and is treated relative to the <resources> directory.
