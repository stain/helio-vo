Should we list refined times as time_start and time_end - other lists use the time_start define by NOAA ???? 
Comparing the X-ray class for flares greater than X9.9 will fail. 
Locations of the flares are sparsely defined in this list.

Suggest the removal of ntime fields as these are not consistent across all the lists. This capability will be provided within the interface.</ListProdNotes>

<ListName>Solar H-alpha flare events</ListName>
<ListPurpose>List of H-alpha flares assembled from ground-based observatories (NGDC)</ListPurpose>
<ListDesc>Flares are characterized by a rise time of the order of minutes and a decay of the order of tens of minutes. The total energy expended in a typical flare is about 10**30 ergs; the magnetic field is extraordinarily high, reaching values of 100 to 10,000 gauss. 

This list is constructed by NGDC from he basic reports sent monthly from the ground-based observatories. The National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) holds archives for about 80 stations, covering the period 1938 to the present. Currently 5 stations send their data to NGDC Boulder on a routine monthly basis. Optical flares in H-alpha are usually accompanied by radio and X-ray bursts, and occasionally by high-energy particle emissions.</ListDesc>

This catalog contains all CMEs manually identified since 1996 from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission. LASCO has three telescopes C1, C2, and C3. However, only C2 and C3 data are used for uniformity because C1 was disabled in June 1998.</ListDesc>

Link to the list of data gaps during the month is also provided. Data gaps of duration 3 h or more are listed. The data-gap list must be consulted before deciding the existence or nonexistence of CMEs. If there is a data gap, it is difficult to say there was a CME or not during the data gap.</ListCaveats>

<ListName>GOES proton events</ListName>
<ListPurpose>Geo-effective solar energetic proton (SEP) events (NOAA)</ListPurpose>
<ListDesc>Proton fluxes are integral 5-minute averages for energies &gt;10 MeV, given in Particle Flux Units (pfu), measured by GOES spacecraft at Geosynchronous orbit: 1 pfu = 1 p cm-2 sr-1 s-1. 

The start of a proton event is identified based on the first of 3 consecutive data points with fluxes greater than or equal to 10 pfu. The end of an event is the last time the flux was greater than or equal to 10 pfu. It should be recognised that this definition allows multiple proton flares and/or interplanetary
shock proton increases to occur within one SWO proton event. Additional data may be necessary to more completely resolve any individual proton event.

Flare associations are given, although data about individual Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), available from SOHO since 1996 only, are necessary to fully characterize each event. CME information for earlier events from the SOLWIND and SMM coronagraphs will be added in the future.</ListDesc>

<ListID>gle_list</ListID>
<ListVersion>1.0</ListVersion>
<ListName>Ground Level Enhancements</ListName>
<ListPurpose>List of ground level events detected by ground-based neutron monitors</ListPurpose>
<ListDesc>Ground level enhancements (GLEs) are sudden increases in the cosmic ray intensity recorded by ground based detectors. GLEs are invariably associated with large solar flares but the acceleration mechanism producing particles of up to tens of GeV is not understood. The increases in ground based measurements ranges from only a few percent of background in polar monitors (with little or no geomagnetic cutoff) to 45 times for the 23 February 1956 event. The rate of GLEs would appear to be about one per year but there may be a slight clumping around solar maximum.

Most solar flares associated with GLEs are located on the western sector of the Sun where the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) is well connected to the Earth. The geometry of this field line is quite variable, as it depends on the strength of the solar wind that varies considerably. Because of its shape it is known as the ``garden hose&apos;&apos; field line. 

GLEs associated with flares located near to the footpoint of the garden hose field line usually arrive promptly and have very sharp onsets. Conversely, GLEs associated with flares far from the garden hose field line are usually delayed in their arrival at Earth and have more gradual increases to maximum intensity. It is very rare to observe GLEs associated with flares to the east of the central meridian or Sun-Earth line. Although a large solar flare is invariably associated with a GLE the flare itself may not be causally related to the production of the high energy protons that produce the GLE response at Earth. Solar energetic particle events are not rare and energetic protons are produced in common with CMEs and interplanetary shocks. These protons do not have sufficient energy to produce secondary particles that reach ground level but are clearly observed by spacecraft. Such CMEs and their associated shocks are most often produced without a solar flare. It is possible that there is a continuum to the acceleration process and that flares are a by-product of the most energetic events. Alternatively, there is a possibility that the flare itself produces a seed population of higher energy protons that are further accelerated to energies sufficient to produce a GLE.

<ListName>Major magnetic Storms (AA*)</ListName>
<ListPurpose>List of major magnetic storms according to the AA* criteria (NGDC)</ListPurpose>
<ListDesc>Daily regular magnetic field variation arise from current systems caused by regular solar radiation changes. Other irregular current systems produce magnetic field changes caused by the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere, by the magnetosphere itself, by the interactions between the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and by the ionosphere itself.

Magnetic activity indices were designed to describe variation in the geomagnetic field caused by these irregular current systems

The aa-index is a simple global geomagnetic activity index. It is derived from the K indices from two approximately antipodal observatories and has units of 1 nT. The K-index is quasi-logarithmic local index of the 3-hourly range in magnetic activity relative to an assumed quiet-day curve for a single geomagnetic observatory site. First introduced by J. Bartels in 1938, it consists of a single-digit 0 thru 9 for each 3-hour interval of the universal time day (UT).

This list has been produced at WDC-A for STP, a now-routine procedure is to take the 3-hourly aa indices when they are received and compute an 8-point running average.  When this mean exceeds 60, a &quot;major magnetic&quot; storm is considered to be in progress.  It is arbitrarily considered to continue in progress until such time as the value drops below a threshold of 60.  Then the maximum mean value attained
is designated AA*.</ListDesc>

<ListName>Major Magnetic Storms (Ap*)</ListName>
<ListPurpose>List of major magnetic storms according to the Ap* criteria (NGDC)</ListPurpose>
<ListDesc>Daily regular magnetic field variation arise from current systems caused by regular solar radiation changes. Other irregular current systems produce magnetic field changes caused by the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere, by the magnetosphere itself, by the interactions between the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and by the ionosphere itself.

Magnetic activity indices were designed to describe variation in the geomagnetic field caused by these irregular current systems.

The 3-hourly ap (equivalent range) index is derived from the Kp index. The planetary 3-hour-range index Kp is the mean standardized K-index from 13 geomagnetic observatories between 44 degrees and 60 degrees northern or southern geomagnetic latitude - for the conversion from Kp to ap, see http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/geomag/kp_ap.html.

The Ap* index is defined as the earliest occurring maximum 24-hour value obtained by computing an 8-point running average of successive 3-hour ap indices during a geomagnetic storm event and is uniquely associated with the storm event. At WDC-A for STP, a now-routine procedure is to take the 3-hourly ap indices when they are received and compute the 8-point running average.  When this mean exceeds 40, a &quot;major magnetic storm&quot; is considered to be in progress. It is arbitrarily considered to continue in progress until such time as the value drops below a threshold of 40.  Then the maximum mean value attained is designated Ap*. When the most disturbed 24-hours begin at the start of the UT-day, the values of Ap and Ap* are identical.</ListDesc>

<ListDesc>The magnetic field configurations propagating through the Heliosphere as Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) also reduce the galactic cosmic ray flux. The count rates before an event are subtracted, and the rates given as a percentage of the count rate as compared to the average values measured before the event. The depressions can attain values of 20%. They are called Forbush decreases after the cosmic ray physicist Scott Forbush. The depressions of cosmic ray flux are ascribed to the shield produced by the complex and turbulent magnetic field structure in and around the ICME and the shock wave it drives ahead of it.</ListDesc>

<ListPurpose>List of solar wind events observed upstream of the earth</ListPurpose>
<ListDesc>The ISTP Science Planning and Operations Facility (SPOF), in collaboration with ISTP investigators, is developing this catalog of preliminary/selected solar wind events and features. The catalog also contains listings of times when WIND and IMP-8 were in the solar wind. Coverage begins on September 8, 1992, the start of ISTP science data collection. With the launch of ACE in 1997, and its permanent coverage of solar wind conditions in near real time we incorporate to our selection interesting time periods also observed with the instruments SWEPAM and MAG in ACE.

The solar wind features are classified into several categories (e.g., interplanetary shock wave, extended period of strong negative Bz, etc.). An extended event has separate start and end times listed for it, whereas a sharp discontinuous event (such as a shock ramp) has the same time listed for both start and end times (clearly, for follow-up studies researchers will need to examine data before and after the listed time).</ListDesc>

Researchers using the catalog should reference its contents with statements such as: The event from &quot;Feb 26, 1995&quot; has been identified as a candidate &quot;Sector Boundary Crossing&quot; worthy of further study. The primary intent for the catalog is to serve as a reference for identifying candidate periods for further study, such as may be the focus of coordinated data analysis efforts during ISTP and/or IACG Science Campaigns.

<ListDesc>This list contains all solar flares recorded with Yohkoh HXT during the interval be-
tween October 1, 1991 and December 14, 2001.

The HXT is a hard X-ray imager of the Fourier-synthesis type, consisting of 64 mod-
ulation subcollimators. Each modulation subcollimator is equipped with a small NaI(Tl)
scintillator and photomultiplier tube, and measures a modulated photon count. A set of
the 64 photon counts, transmitted from the satellite to the ground, is converted into an
image by image synthesis procedures. The main characteristics of HXT are summarized
below:
i) Simultaneous imaging in four energy bands, namely, the L-band (13.9 - 22.7 keV),
M1-band (22.7 - 32.7 keV), M2-band (32.7 - 52.7 keV), and H-band (52.7 - 92.8 keV).
Ii) Angular resolution of about 5 arcsec with a wide field of view covering the whole Sun.
Iii) Basic temporal resolution of 0.5 s.
Iv) High sensitivity with an effective area of about 60 cm2.</ListDesc>

In the Yohkoh operation, the observation mode is automatically controlled by the
onboard Data Processor, and intense flares trigger the so-called Flare mode. Weak flares,
however, are recorded in the Quiet mode without triggering the Flare mode. Since only
the L-band count rate is recorded in the Quiet mode, flares sometimes lack the M1-, M2-,
and H-band count rates.</ListCaveats>

<ListName>HESSI Flare List</ListName>
<ListPurpose>List of hard X-ray flares seen by RHESSI.</ListPurpose>
<ListDesc>The RHESSI flare list is created during quicklook processing (and is often re-processed). 

The flare list is obtained by comparing the observing summary count rate in the 6 to 12 keV energy band to a threshold. The count rate threshold is determined from the background level; which is obtained using a 60 second running average. For an interval to be considered as a flare candidate, the count rate must be greater than 3*sigma above the background level. Variations in the count rate due to changes in attenuator state or decimation state are taken into account by use of the &quot;corrected&quot; count rate method, which empirically determines the corrections. 

A flare candidate is flagged as a possible solar flare if the ratio of the count rate in the front detectors to total count rate is 3 sigma above its own background level (also determined using a 60 second running average). An exception is made if there is an SAA crossing or data gap; for those cases the front - total ratio must be greater than 60% in the interval for that interval to be considered to be a possible flare. 

Even with the front - total ratio test, particle precipitation events can be confused with flares. The candidate is only confirmed as a solar flare if a valid position is found in the 6 to 12 keV energy band.</ListDesc>

<ListDesc>Abstract taken from &apos;A CATALOG OF CORONAL &quot;EIT WAVE&quot; TRANSIENTS&apos; by B. J. Thompson and D. C. Myers, The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series 183 (2009) 225.

Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) data have been visually searched for coronal &quot;EIT wave&quot; transients over the period beginning from 1997 March 24 and extending through 1998 June 24. The dates covered start at the beginning of regular high-cadence (more than 1 image every 20 minutes) observations, ending at the four-month interruption of SOHO observations in mid-1998. One hundred and seventy six events are included in this catalog. The observations range from &quot;candidate&quot; events, which were either weak or had insufficient data coverage, to events which were well defined and were clearly distinguishable in the data. Included in the catalog are times of the EIT images in which the events are observed, diagrams indicating the observed locations of the wave fronts and associated active regions, and the speeds of the wave fronts. The measured speeds of the wave fronts varied from less than 50 to over 700 km s–1 with &quot;typical&quot; speeds of 200-400 km s–1.

<ListName>Wind MFI magnetic clouds</ListName>
<ListPurpose>List of Magnetic Cloud events observed by the WIND MFI instrument.</ListPurpose>
<ListDesc>A magnetic cloud is a transient ejection in the solar wind defined by relatively strong magnetic fields, a large and smooth rotation of the magnetic field direction over approximately 0.25AU at 1AU, and a low proton temperature [Burlaga et al., 1981]. Magnetic clouds are ideal objects for solar-terrestrial studies because of their simplicity and their extended intervals of southward and northward magnetic fields [Burlaga et al., 1990]

The table consists of estimated start and end times that were estimated by a magnetic field model [Lepping et al., 1990] that assumes that the field within the magnetic cloud is force free, i.e., so that the electrical current and the magnetic field are parallel and proportional in strength everywhere within its volume.</ListDesc>

<ListPurpose>List of WIND MFI Bow Shock crossing times</ListPurpose>
<ListDesc>The Bow Shock is the shock wave observed just upstream of the Earth&apos;s magnetosphere caused by the supersonic and super-Alfvenic solar wind ramming into the Earth&apos;s magnetosphere. (SuperAlfvenic refers to when the solar wind&apos;s speed exceeds a characteristic speed that depends on the solar wind&apos;s density and the interplanetary magnetic field strength.) The MFI team has provided a list of all WIND bow shock crossings. 

The event list provides a list of bow shock (BS) crossing times. For each crossing, the following times are given:

    The time of the last BS crossing as the spacecraft was leaving the Earth magnetosheath. 
    The first full hour which has only unshocked solar wind data in it.
    The last full hour which still contains interplanetary magnetic field data.
    The time of the 1st BS crossing on the way into the Earth magnetosphere.</ListDesc>

<ListVersion>1.0</ListVersion>
<ListName>SOHO PM IP shocks</ListName>
<ListPurpose>An incomplete list of possible Interplanetary Shocks observed by the SOHO PM.</ListPurpose>
<ListDesc>The Shockspotter program attempts to identify possible interplanetary shocks using the near-real time data from the CELIAS/MTOF/PM sensor on the SOHO spacecraft. 

There are several reasons for developing automated procedures for identifying various interplanetary structures; for example the online capability of such techniques would be a useful addition to a space weather warning system, and could be used by spacecraft to make on-board decisions to change modes of operation. In addition, the objectivity of such an automated identification system is a benefit for unbiased statistical analyses.

Rigorously, shocks cannot be identified using solely solar wind proton data; one needs electron and minor ion measurements in addition to magnetic field measurements (there is no magnetometer on SOHO). Nevertheless, a reasonable system of identification of at least the larger shocks is possible using only the PM data.

This simplified Table lists the expected behavior of solar wind parameters across some common interplanetary structures:

The type II burst catalog is derived from the Wind/WAVES catalog available at http://lep694.gsfc.nasa.gov/waves/waves.html by adding a few missing events. 

The CMEs in this catalog are called radio-loud CMEs because of their ability to produce type II radio bursts. The CME sources are also listed, as derived from the Solar Geophysical Data listing or from inner coronal images such as Yohkoh/SXT and SOHO/EIT. Some solar sources have also been obtained from Solarsoft Latest Events Archive after October 1, 2002: http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/latest_events_archive.html</ListDesc>

Each table entry consists of a start and stop time and an upper and lower frequency limit. The four items form a box on the dynamic spectrum which contains the bursts. It is not always the case that the highest (lowest) frequency happens at the earliest (latest) time. Also included in most entries are comments and a dynamic spectrum of at least part of the emission. The dynamic spectra come in two flavors: those marked with &apos;S&apos; or &apos;X&apos; are standard frequency versus time dynamic spectra. Those marked with &apos;F&apos; are inverse frequency versus time, corresponding roughly to distance from the sun versus time.</ListDesc>

Sunspot No: The SESC sunspot number for the indicated date is from the daily 
Solar Region Summary issued by SESC. The SESC sunspot number is computed 
according to the Wolf Sunspot Number R=k (10g+s), where g is the number of 
sunspot groups (regions), s is the total number of individual spots in all 
the groups, and k is a variable scaling factor (usually &lt;1) that indicates 
the combined effects of observing conditions, telescope, and bias of the 
solar observers.  A sunspot number of zero indicates there were no visible 
sunspots on that date; a * indicates that no observations were taken. The   
sunspot region information used to compute the daily sunspot number 
incorporates reports from as many as six observatories.  These reports 
are used to form a composite picture of each individual region, including 
sunspot number, area and classification, taking into account such factors as  
the time of observation and the quality of seeing.  This composite 
information is the daily average obtained from the reporting observatories 
and may not represent the latest data. It is reported daily in the Solar 
Region Summary and listed in the Region Summary section of the Weekly.

Sunspot Area : Sum of the corrected area of all observed sunspots, in units of 
millionths of the solar hemisphere.

X-ray Background Flux : The daily average background x-ray flux as measured on 
the SWPC primary GOES satellite. Note: X-ray flux values below the B1 level can 
be erroneous. Energetic electron contamination of the x-ray sensors occurs. At 
times of high electron flux at geosynchronous altitude, the x-ray measurements
in the low A-class range can be in error by 20-30%. Measurements taken during
periods of low energetic electron fluxes are much more accurate.
   Daily GOES X-ray Background Flux algorithm:
     o The 24 one-hour X-ray 1-8 Angstrom; values are divided into three 
       8-hour sections
     o The minimum for each of these three 8-hour sections is determined;
         ... Call them min1, min2, and min3
     o The average of the minima from the first and last 8-hour sections 
        is calculated: min_avg = 1/2 (min1 + min3)
     o Daily Background X-Ray Flux is the smallest of min2 or min_avg
      X-Ray_background = minimum of (min2 or min_avg)&lt;/li&gt;
            
Flares : The total number of optical and x-ray flares observed during the day.

Missing data is shown as -1, except X-ray Background Flux is shown as *.</ListDesc>

<ListName>DRAO 10.7cm Radio Flux Monitor</ListName>
<ListPurpose>General index of solar activity (DRAO)</ListPurpose>
<ListDesc>This index provides measurements of the 10.7cm Flux taken by DRAO. Each measurement is expressed in three values: the &quot;observed&quot;, &quot;adjusted&quot; and &quot;URSI Series D.&quot; values. 

The &quot;sfu_observed&quot; value is the number measured by the solar radio telescope. Since it is a measure of the emissions due to solar activity hitting the Earth, this is the quantity to use when terrestrial phenomena are being studied. This measurement is modulated by two quantities: the level of solar activity and the changing distance between the Earth and Sun.

The &quot;adjusted&quot; value is corrected for the annual modulation due to the changing distance between the Earth and Sun and is the quantity to use when solar phenomena are being studied.

Absolute measurements of flux density are quite difficult, and in the early years of solar radio astronomy, considerable effort around the world went into making absolute measurements of the solar flux density at a number of different frequencies. An attempt was then made to fit all these various data to a spectrum. Each set of measurements was then given a scaling factor that would move them right onto the fitted spectrum. For the 10.7cm Solar Flux a scaling factor of 0.9 was estimated. In the light of later work, this work should possibly be redone. However, we also give in the database the &quot;Series D Flux&quot;, which is the &quot;adjusted&quot; value multiplied by 0.9.

Three flux determinations are made each day. Between March and October measurements are made at 1700, 2000 (local noon) and 2300UT. However, the combination of location in a mountain valley and a relatively high latitude make it impossible to maintain these times during the rest of the year. Consequently, from November through February, the flux determination times are changed to 1800, 2000 and 2200, so that the Sun is high enough above the horizon for a good measurement to be made.

The record for each measurement of the 10.7cm Solar Flux is as below. The quantities are separated by commas. The 10.7cm Solar Flux is given in solar flux units (an sfu = 10-22.m-2.Hz-1)</ListDesc>

<ListName>Gopalswamy CME list</ListName>
<ListPurpose>List of Halo CMEs and associated flares and geomagnetic storms.</ListPurpose>
<ListDesc>Three sets of information are listed: (i) halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs), (ii) Associated flares  and (iii) Associated geomagnetic storms. 

The halo CME list is obtained from the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog (http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list). The solar source location for each halo is obtained as the location of the associated H-alpha flare location if available from the online Solar Geophysical Data. Otherwise, the flare is identified by playing superposed LASCO and EIT movies along with GOES plots and deriving the heliographic coordinates of the associated flare from SOHO/EIT images. The minimum value of the Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) index is obtained from the World Data Center in Kyoto (http://swdcdb.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dstdir/). A 4-day long time window was chosen starting at CME onset+1 day and ending at CME onset + 5 days. The minimum value of Dst index in this time window after is halo CME is assigned to the halo CME.</ListDesc>

<ListPurpose>A list of solar X-ray events deteced by the Gamma Ray Burst (GMB) experiment on Ulysses</ListPurpose>
<ListDesc>Abstract from Tranquille et al, Solar Phys (2009) 258:

Ulysses was launched in October 1990, and its Solar X-ray/Cosmic Gamma-Ray Burst Experiment (GRB) has provided more than 13 years of uninterrupted observations of solar X-ray flare activity. Due to the large variation of the relative solar latitude and longitude of the spacecraft orbit with respect to the Earth, the perspective of the GRB instrument often differed significantly from that of X-ray instruments on Earth-orbiting satellites. During extended periods the GRB experiment made direct observations of flares on the hidden face of the Sun, providing a unique record of events not visible to other instruments. The small detector area of GRB and its optimization for very high counting rates minimized the effects of pulse pile-up.We interpret the spectra, time histories, and occurrence distribution patterns of GRB data in terms of “thermal feed-through”, the confusion of thermal soft X-rays and non-thermal hard X-rays. This effect is a systematic problem for scintillation-counter spectrometers observing the solar hard X-ray spectrum. This paper provides a definitive catalog of the Ulysses X-ray flare observations and discusses various features of this unique database. For the equivalent GOES range X2 –X25, we find a power-law fit for the (differential) occurrence frequency at &gt;25 keV with slope −1.61 ± 0.04, with no evidence for a downturn at the highest event magnitudes (for the relatively small sample of such events available in this study). If the nine most intense events are excluded because of concerns about the effects of pulse pile-up, the slope steepens to −1.75±0.08.</ListDesc>
<ListProdNotes>This list has not yet been implemented and is included here to assist with refactoring of the HEC.

Need to check if this is a super set of all the lists or if need to also ingest other lists.

Also need to make sure parameter names are consistent.</ListProdNotes>
