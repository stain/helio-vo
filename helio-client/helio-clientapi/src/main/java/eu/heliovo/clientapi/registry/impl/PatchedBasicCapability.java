/**
 * Describes a service capability interface belonging to a registry resource.
 * This typically provides an access URL at which the service can be found,
 * as well as some other metadata.
 *
 * <p>This class conflates the concepts of Capability and Interface.
 * In VOResource 1.0 the Capability:Interface relationship is one:many,
 * but in practice it is, as far as I can see, nearly always one:one.
 * In the case of finding an actual one:many relationship, we just use
 * multiple {@link BasicCapability} objects all related to the same
 * Capability.
